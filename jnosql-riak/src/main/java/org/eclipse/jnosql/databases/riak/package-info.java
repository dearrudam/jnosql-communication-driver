 * Riak is a distributed NoSQL key-value data store that offers high availability,
 * fault tolerance, operational simplicity, and scalability. In addition to the open-source version,
 * it comes in a supported enterprise version and a cloud storage version. Riak implements the principles
 * from Amazon's Dynamo paper with heavy influence from the CAP Theorem. Written in Erlang, Riak has fault
 * tolerance data replication and automatic data distribution across the cluster for performance and resilience.
