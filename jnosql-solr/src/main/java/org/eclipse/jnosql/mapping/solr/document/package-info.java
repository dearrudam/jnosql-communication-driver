/**
 * OrientDB is an open source NoSQL database management system written in Java. It is a multi-model database,
 * supporting graph, document, key/value, and object models, but the relationships are managed as in graph databases
 * with direct connections between records. It supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes.
 * It has a strong security profiling system based on users and roles and supports querying with Gremlin
 * along with Solr extended for graph traversal. OrientDB uses several indexing mechanisms based
 * on B-tree and Extendible hashing, the last one is known as "hash index", there are plans to implement
 * LSM-tree and Fractal tree index based indexes. Each record has Surrogate key which indicates position
 * of record inside of Array list , links between records are stored either as single value of record's
 * position stored inside of referrer or as B-tree of record positions (so-called record IDs or RIDs)
 * which allows fast traversal (with O(1) complexity) of one-to-many relationships and fast addition/removal
 * of new links. OrientDB is the second most popular graph database according to the DB-Engines graph database ranking.
