= Running Tests with Eclipse JNoSQL and OrientDB

== Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure that you have at least an OrientDB instance running. You can use Docker to make it easier. Use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker run -d --name orientdb -p 2424:2424 -p 2480:2480 -e ORIENTDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpwd orientdb:latest
----

== Running the Tests

To run the tests, execute the following Maven command:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean test
----

This will run the test suite for Eclipse JNoSQL with OrientDB.

NOTE: Make sure that the OrientDB instance is running before executing the tests.

You can replace `orientdb:latest` with a specific version if needed.
