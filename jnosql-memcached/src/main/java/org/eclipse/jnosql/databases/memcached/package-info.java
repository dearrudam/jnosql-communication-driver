/**
 * Memcached (pronunciation: mem-cashed, mem-cash-dee) is a general-purpose distributed memory caching system.
 * It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce
 * the number of times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read. Memcached is free and
 * open-source software, licensed under the Revised BSD license. Memcached runs on Unix-like operating systems
 * (at least Linux and OS X) and on Microsoft Windows. It depends on the libevent library.
 * Memcached's APIs provide a very large hash table distributed across multiple machines.
 * When the table is full, subsequent inserts cause older data to be purged in least recently used (LRU) order.
